                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>With the rise of the world population, increased food production is warranted, 
                    however the decline in arable land as soil health and fertility decreases raises 
                    a cause for concern. The most important nutrient fertile soil needs is nitrogen. 
                    The main cause of loss of nutrients in soil is erosion. Erosion removes many nutrients 
                    and bacteria from soil which are crucial to soil fertility. Erosion occurs through many 
                    human activities and poor farming practices. Human activities that cause erosion include 
                    mining and logging. The commonly used clear cutting technique compacts the soil, exposes 
                    bare soil to the elements, and induces nutrient runoff. Open-pit mining loosens soil, 
                    introduces soil pollutants, and removes topsoil. Poor farming techniques such as excessive 
                    use of chemical pesticides, monocropping , and over tilling. These techniques create erosion,
                     removing soil nutrients and bacteria. These human activities and farming techniques all lead
                      to the progressive removal of nitrogen and nitrogen cycle bacteria, degrading soil health
                       and fertility. ​</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The nitrogen cycle is the essential process which regulates how nitrogen moves through 
                    the soil, air, and organisms. There are several types of bacteria involved in the nitrogen 
                    cycle. This includes nitrogen-fixating bacteria and nitrifying bacteria. Nitrogen fixing 
                    bacteria such as rhizobium transform atmospheric nitrogen gas into ammonia compounds which 
                    is used by plants. Nitrifying bacteria such as nitrosomonas  and nitrobacter convert ammonia
                     to nitrates for plant growth and proteins. These bacterial soil microorganisms are crucial
                      for regulating the nitrogen cycle, soil health, and fertility. ​</p>

                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <P>
                    How can we use qPCR to design a simple and efficient method to test soil health and quality for agricultural purposes?​<br>

                    How can we use qPCR to analyze the nitrogen cycle in soil and design a soil treatment plan?​<br>
                    
                    What soil compositions are most fertile and what bacterial nitrogen microorganisms do they support?​<br>
                    
                    How do ratios of types of bacteria differ between soil samples and how does this affect soil health?​<br>
                    
                    How do qPCR nitrogen bacteria results compare to chemical nitrogen test results?

                </P>

                <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
                <p>If nitrogen cycle bacteria is quantified in eDNA soil samples, then the data can be compared to chemical tests for 
                    macronutrients in order to analyze the correlation between the data and be used to determine soil health. Different soil 
                    compositions will contain different level of nitrogen cycle bacteria which will impact soil health and fertility. ​</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>In this research, soil samples of various compositions were collected from various environments and locations. These 
                    samples were used for macronutrient tests and qPCR analysis. Within the qPCR analysis nitrogen fixing bacteria and 
                    nitrifying bacteria were quantified and detected in the soil samples. A soil composition test was performed to determine 
                    the texture class of each soil sample. Additionally, a "growth test" was conducted for real-world application to agriculture and farming. ​</p>
